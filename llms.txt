# Web Awesome

> A forward-thinking library of web components. Version 3.1.0.

Web Awesome provides a comprehensive set of customizable, accessible web components for building modern
web applications. All components use shadow DOM and are framework-agnostic, working with vanilla JavaScript
or any framework including React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.

Form controls are form-associated custom elements that work with native form validation and the
Constraint Validation API.

Font Awesome is the default icon library, so `<wa-icon name="...">` values should reference Font Awesome
icon names.

- `arrowPlacement` (attribute: `arrow-placement`): The placement of the arrow. The default is `anchor`, which will align the arrow as close to the center of the anchor as possible, considering available space and `arrow-padding`.

- `arrowPadding` (attribute: `arrow-padding`): The amount of padding between the arrow and the edges of the popup. If the popup has a border-radius, for example, this will prevent it from overflowing the corners. (Type: `number`, Default: `10`)

- `flipBoundary`: The flip boundary describes clipping element(s) that overflow will be checked relative to when flipping. By default, the boundary includes overflow ancestors that will cause the element to be clipped. If needed, you can change the boundary by passing a reference to one or more elements to this property. (Type: `Element | Element[]`)
- `flipPadding` (attribute: `flip-padding`): The amount of padding, in pixels, to exceed before the flip behavior will occur. (Type: `number`, Default: `0`)

- `autoSizePadding` (attribute: `auto-size-padding`): The amount of padding, in pixels, to exceed before the auto-size behavior will occur. (Type: `number`, Default: `0`)
- `hoverBridge` (attribute: `hover-bridge`): When a gap exists between the anchor and the popup element, this option will add a "hover bridge" that fills the gap using an invisible element. This makes listening for events such as `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` more sane because the pointer never technically leaves the element. The hover bridge will only be drawn when the popover is active. (Type: `boolean`, Default: `false`)

**Methods:**

- `reposition()`: Forces the popup to recalculate and reposition itself.

**Events:**

- `wa-reposition`: Emitted when the popup is repositioned. This event can fire a lot, so avoid putting expensive operations in your listener or consider debouncing it.

- `hover-bridge`: The hover bridge element. Only available when the `hover-bridge` option is enabled.

(Type: `HTMLFormElement | null`)
- `validationTarget`: Override this to change where constraint validation popups are anchored. (Type: `undefined | HTMLElement`)

**Methods:**

- `focus(options: FocusOptions)`: Sets focus on the textarea.

- `setCustomValidity(message: string)`: Do not use this when creating a "Validator". This is intended for end users of components. We track manually defined custom errors so we don't clear them on accident in our validators.
- `formStateRestoreCallback(state: string | File | FormData | null, reason: 'autocomplete' | 'restore')`: Called when the browser is trying to restore element’s state to state in which case reason is "restore", or when the browser is trying to fulfill autofill on behalf of user in which case reason is "autocomplete". In the case of "restore", state is a string, File, or FormData object previously set as the second argument to setFormValue.
